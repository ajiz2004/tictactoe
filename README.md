## Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using the PERN Stack

### Project Overview
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using the **PERN Stack** (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js). Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe games, this version ensures that the game data is not lost after refreshing the page. The use of a **PostgreSQL** database, **Node.js** backend, and **React** frontend allows for persistent game state, meaning your game progress will be saved even after a page refresh.

### Features
- **Persistent Game Data**: The game uses a **PostgreSQL** database to save the game state. This ensures that your game data is preserved, even after the page is refreshed.
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: The app utilizes the **PERN Stack** for a complete full-stack solution:
  - **Frontend**: Built with **React.js** to create an interactive user interface.
  - **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage API requests and serve the frontend.
  - **Database**: **PostgreSQL** is used to store game state, ensuring that data is not lost during page reloads.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
